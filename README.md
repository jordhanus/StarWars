# StarWars

Much to the horror of my wife and daughters, I am quite the Star Wars fan. Over here, I will keep this enthusiasm limited to data-related applications. Enter Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a terribly addictive mobile game. In this repo you can find two short scripts that expand the possibilities of https://hotutils.com, an awesome add-on to the game that automates a BUNCH of stuff, especially for officers. Since I did find the Hotutils services lacking in two distinct use cases, I wrote short scripts in R and Python to solve this for my guild and me. With some tinkering perfectly viable for anyone to use, make sure to reach out to me if you do have questions!
